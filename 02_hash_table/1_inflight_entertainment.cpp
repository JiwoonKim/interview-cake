/**
 *  Determine if there exists a pair of ints (in vector) which sum equals the given int
 *  + make sure that the same int is not used in a pair
 * 
 *  Time Complexity: O(n)
 *  Space Complexity: O(n)
 * 
 *  * What I learned:
 * 
 *    ** be careful when returning values w/ for loop
 *       -> could end up returning void if not constructed carefully
 *       => solution: always have a return statement after the loop
 *                    - construct it as return true when condition satisfied, and after loop return false
 *                      or the other way around
 * 
 *                    ex. for (...)
 *                          if (...)
 *                              return true 
 *                        return false // return statement after loop
 * 
 *    2) use map/set for constant lookup time
 *       -> always ask yourself, right from the start: "Can I save time by using an unordered map/set?"
 * 
 *    ** check pairs in single loop (one-pass hash table)
 *       - instead of first storing all elements in map/set and then checking each element for its match in map/set (=> two sequential loops),
 *       -> "check pairs while adding to map/set (=> in single loop)"
 *           (keep track of items we've seen so far)
 * 
 *           -> take advantage that "finding pairs is bi-directional"
 *              (ex. (1, 3) -> can find pair from 1: findOther(1) = 3 
 *                                      or from 3: findOther(3) = 1
 *              => either way results in finding a single pair      )
 * 
 *       ** loop over elements once ("check match && store those w/ no match to check later in map/set")
 *          - if (match exists in collection) -> return true
 *          - else -> store for checking later (if there is a match, it will be called on later elements)
 * 
 *       => this prevents pairs with same element used twice (element, sameElement)
 *          (if duplicates (two elements w/ same value), 
 *           then one will be stored in collection 
 *           and the other will be outside, checking if there is duplicate inside collection)
 *          : ensures that the pair is duplicates and not the same element
 * 
 *          cf) if want to allow same elements to be used in pair, just add simple condition
 *              - if (findOther(element) == element || match exists in collection) -> true
 *              - else -> store for checking later (if there is a match, it will be called on later elements)
